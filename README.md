# ÂµDBML
Microscopic Database Markdown Language
(Coming soon)
## Mission Statement
Database design requires precision, and every tool that is used is tedious to use and has too many options. A strongly opinionated but versatile stripped-down system is badly needed to expedite and streamline rapid database development and trivialize change management. This is an attempt at making such a tool.
## Expected Roadmap

- 04/2023: Concept overview/Documentation
